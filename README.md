# vehiicle-data_analalysis
This project analyzes Indian vehicle registration data (2009â€“2015) to identify top states, study two-wheeler growth, and predict future registrations using linear regression. Tools used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
Vehicle Registration Analysis in India (2009â€“2020)
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project analyzes vehicle registration data from different Indian states between 2009 and 2015.
It identifies the top 5 states with the highest registrations, determines the vehicle type with the most growth (two-wheelers), and predicts two-wheeler registrations in Maharashtra from 2016 to 2020 using a linear regression model.
